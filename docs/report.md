# Lab Report
Group number: 12 <br>
Group members: Matteo Carnelos, Fernando Labra Caso, Fernando Castell <br>
Code repository: https://github.com/matteocarnelos/kadlab

## Introduction

This document contains an explanation of the process of developing a distributed
file system implemented with the _Kademlia Algorithm_. <br>

The project is required as the practical approach for the **Mobile and Distributed
Computing Systems** course of the LTU.

Whether we choose one tool instead of another or we decide to use some specific
methodology, everything will be recorded. <br>

## Frameworks and Tools

###Markdown
<p>
We use Markdown as the markup language for formatting the Lab Report of this project.
It is as elegant and easy to use as it is efficient in providing structured documents. <br>

Another option for writing this document was LaTeX, which at a starting point we had considered,
but due to a more complex syntax we decided to leave it aside.
</p>

###Go Language
<p>
As it was recommended by the professor, we decided to use Golang for the development of this
project, not only because of its appealing syntax and the first class object usage, but also
because of its management of threads and channels for distributed programming.
</p>

###Goland
<p>
For the Integrated Development Environment we use Goland, developed for Golang programmers by
the JetBrains company.
</p>

###Git
<p>
Git is the tool for managing the repositories. As we would for sure need a repository for holding our code,
we considered indispensable to include it in our project.
</p>

###Github
<p>
For the repository platform we use Github. It is a common choice for the storage of code and we all had used
it in other university projects, so we considered it appropiate.
</p>

###Fork
<p>
Fork is a Graphic User Interface for better managing the operations through git. Not only shows the different
changes in branches but also has very a intuitive form.
</p>

###Docker
<p>

</p>

###LUDD Distributed Systems and Technologies
<p>
For the deployment of the container, we needed a virtual machine that could hold up to as many instances
as required for the distributed system to work in the best condition.

As LTU students, LUDD (Lule√• Academic Computer Society) offers services in the computing field, and their subsection
DUST (Distributed Systems and Technologies) virtual machines with different configurations, which we certainly chose 
for deploying our containers and code.
